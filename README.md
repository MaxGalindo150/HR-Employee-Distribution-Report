# Project Title: Geographic Employee Distribution Analysis in the United States using SQL and Power BI

## Description:

In this captivating project, we delve deep into the geographic, racial, gender, and age distribution of employees within a company with a presence in the United States. Leveraging advanced SQL skills and data visualization in Power BI, this project showcases my ability to analyze complex data and effectively communicate insightful findings.

## Highlights:

- **Data Collection and Cleansing:** Relevant employee data, including demographic and location information, was gathered and prepared for analysis. SQL was utilized for data transformations to ensure data integrity.

- **Geographic Distribution Analysis:** SQL queries were applied to segment and analyze the distribution of employees across different states in the United States. Geographic patterns and trends were identified, and employee counts per state were calculated.

- **Persuasive Visualization:** Using Power BI, analysis results were visualized in a clear and persuasive manner. Interactive charts and geographical maps were created to highlight disparities in employee distribution, providing quick visual understanding.

- **Opportunity Identification:** Through analysis, states with significant employee concentration, as well as those with more limited presence, were identified. These insights led to opportunities for strategic resource expansion or reallocation.

- **Actionable Recommendations:** Based on the results, actionable recommendations were generated to enhance employee distribution. These recommendations could contribute to more effective workforce optimization and better alignment with regional demands.

## Potential Impact:

This project demonstrates my ability to blend robust data analysis with compelling visualization to deliver strategic insights effectively. By identifying opportunities and proposing concrete recommendations, this analysis could have a tangible impact on human resource decision-making and overall business planning.
